/**
  * Scala provides package objects as a convenient container shared across an entire package.
  *
  * Package objects can contain arbitrary definitions, not just variable and method definitions.
  * For instance, they are frequently used to hold package-wide type aliases and implicit conversions.
  *
  * Package objects can even inherit Scala classes and traits.
  *
  * By convention, the source code for a package object is usually put in a source file named package.scala.
  *
  * Each package is allowed to have one package object. Any definitions placed in a package object
  * are considered members of the package itself.
