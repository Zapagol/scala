## The Main Scala collections classes

The main Scala collections classes youâ€™ll use on a regular basis are:

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ArrayBuffer` | an indexed, mutable sequence |
| `List` | a linear (linked list), immutable sequence |
| `Vector` | an indexed, immutable sequence |
| `Map` | the base `Map` (key/value pairs) class |
| `Set` | the base `Set` class |

`Map` and `Set` come in both mutable and immutable versions.
